## üîç Project Overview

**GenCam** is an intelligent visual scene analysis system that integrates traditional Image Signal Processing (ISP) techniques with cutting-edge Generative AI models. The system takes input from camera feeds or image files, enhances them using ISP-inspired optimization (e.g., exposure, contrast, noise reduction), and then generates natural language descriptions using vision-language models like BLIP or CLIP.

This project bridges embedded camera system knowledge with AI-based scene understanding ‚Äî making it ideal for research in smart imaging, autonomous vision systems, or human-AI visual interpretation.
